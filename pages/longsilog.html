<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Pour ½ cup of water into a pan and bring to a light boil on low to medium heat</li>
    <li>Add longanisa to the boiling water and cook for about 20 minutes or until all of the water has evaporated</li>
    <li>While allowing longanisa to boil, mince 4 cloves of garlic for the sinangag</li>

    <li>Separate links by cutting with scissors or a fork</li>
    <li>Turn off stove and cover pan with aluminum foil while cooking the rest of the dish</li>
    <li>In a separate pan, add 3 tsp of cooking oil and turn to medium heat</li>
    <li>When the oil is heated, add minced garlic to the pan and cook until golden brown
        <ol class="latin">
            <li>Make sure that the oil is not too hot to ensure that the garlic does not burn</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Add the day-old rice to the pan and stirfry for 3-5 minutes, making sure that rice is coated with oil and garlic is mixed with rice well
